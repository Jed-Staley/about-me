          <h3>About Jed</h3>
          <p class="mainPara">Jed Staley was born in Columbia, Missouri in 2003 but settled down in Charlotte, North Carolina 
            to be close to his 5 nieces and nephews. He attended Catawba Valley Community College for his junior 
            and senior years of high school, but did not return after his high school graduation. He worked for Amazon
            Inc. for 6 months, but pivoted to a sales job with SAS Retail Services in order to work days.
